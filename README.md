# Frontend Assignment

With the `/data/merchants.json` (provided in this repo), create the following
pages:

- An overview of merchants with ten merchants per page
- An edit form for that merchant
  - Error handling on this form
- A confirmation page shown after saving

Focus on something you can demo to a product owner and one front-end
colleague. Feel free to move or add any files you need to make this work.
You can also install packages as you see fit.

## Expectations

- Using this codebase is advised, but not required
- Use your own creativity on the design
- It's responsive with a mobile first mindset
- Use all properties provided in the json file
- Try and make it as accessible as you can (WCAG)

TIP: In the `/extras` folder you can find some fonts and colors.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the
browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run storybook`

This will start Storybook locally and output the address. It will
automatically open the address in a new browser tab, and you'll be greeted
by a welcome screen.\
See the section about [writing stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for
the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
