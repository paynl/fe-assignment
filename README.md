# Front-end assignment

In this assignment, you'll be developing key components of a merchant management system,
which is a crucial part of our larger admin panel. Your work will directly impact how our
product managers and admins interact with merchant data. You're tasked with creating a
user interface for a merchant management system.

Create a small app with the following criteria:

- As a user, I want to see an overview of merchants so that I can quickly understand how many partners we have.
  - Display at least the name, an image, description, website, email and the time it was added
- As a user, I need to edit merchant details to keep information up to date.
- As a user, I want clear feedback when I make errors in forms to correct them easily and when saving was successful

Consider the layout and design for an optimal user experience. How would you make the
interface intuitive and user-friendly?

Focus on something you can demo to a product owner and a front-end
colleague. Feel free to move or add any files you need to make this work.
You can also install packages as you see fit, or start from scratch with tools of your choosing
(as long as you use TypeScript and React).

## Expectations

- Ensure your pages are responsive and provide a consistent experience across different devices
- Consider the performance of your application. How would you ensure it loads quickly and runs smoothly?
- Make sure your application is accessible, considering users with different abilities
- Include unit and/or integration tests to ensure the reliability of your code
- Provide a README file explaining your architecture choices, how to run your project, and any other relevant information

TIP: In the `/extras` folder you can find some fonts and colors.

## Quality standards

We assess your coding skills based on your ability to adhere to industry-standard
conventions and best practices. Key factors we consider include:

- **Code readability:** Your code should be easily understandable. Organized, well-commented,
and clean code is what we look for.
- **Design pattern utilization:** Appropriate use of design patterns demonstrates your grasp
of coding best practices.
- **Code structure and linting:** To ensure your code is well-structured and consistent, we
recommend using a linter. This helps in maintaining code quality and spotting potential
errors.

Additionally, testing is not just a practice but a cornerstone of our development
process. We expect you to provide tests for your solution, showcasing your
commitment to reliable and maintainable code.

## Submission requirements

Please provide the following in your submission:

- **Source Code:** Share your source code either as a zipped file or through a private GitHub
or Gitlab repository link.
- **README Documentation:** Include a README file that:
  - Briefly outlines the general concept of your project.
  - Describes the architecture and major components of your application.
- **Assumptions:** Clearly articulate any assumptions you've made during the development process.
- **Execution instructions:** Provide detailed steps on how to run your application, ensuring they are straightforward and clear.
- **Testing and linting guide:** Include instructions for executing your unit tests and running the linter. This should detail any specific commands or steps necessary for these processes.

Your thorough and detailed submission will enable us to effectively evaluate your technical skills and approach to software development. We're looking forward to seeing your creative solutions and thoughtful code structure!

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the
browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run storybook`

This will start Storybook locally and output the address. It will
automatically open the address in a new browser tab, and you'll be greeted
by a welcome screen.\
See the section about [writing stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for
the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)
for more information.
